# AlgoriSim
This is a repository for the implementation of a CPU Algorithm Scheduling Algorithm Simulator for a requirement in the course CMSC 125 - M.

# Description
AlgoriSim is a Java-based scheduling algorithm simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to visualize and simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms, including:

* First Come, First Served (FCFS)
* Round Robin (RR)
* Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
* Priority Scheduling Preemptive and Non-Preemptive

# System Requirements
* Java Development Kit (JDK): JDK 21 or later
* Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
* IDE (Optional): Visual Studio Code or any Java-compatible IDE
